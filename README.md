# Rule-Based-Generalization-using-Parallel-Neural-Network
Rule based generalization using training based parallel neural network.
Dataset used consist of three board games- Poker, Tic tac toe and Connect 4.

Basically an "X implies Y" learning system. Model trained using training ased parallel neural network using MLP and RBF algorithms.
